# Friendly EVM

A lightweight implementation of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) written in Java with Spring Boot.  
This project is meant for educational and experimental purposes â€” it simulates execution of EVM bytecode, manages the stack, memory, storage, and supports a growing subset of opcodes.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure

- **`models/`** â€“ Core domain objects (`EVMContext`, `EVMStack`, `EVMCode`, etc.)
- **`service/vm/`** â€“ Service classes that handle specific opcode families (`ArithmeticService`, `JumpService`, `StorageService`, etc.)
- **`vm/`** â€“ The `EVM` engine that coordinates execution.
- **`runner/`** â€“ Spring Boot `CommandLineRunner` entry point.
- **`config/`** â€“ Spring configuration classes that wire up `EVMContext` and related beans.
